A few weeks I wrote a post about using [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) to get type safe requests between a web client and the
server. It turns out that there is an _**even simpler**_ way of calling your AWS backend (still using tRPC) ü§Ø!

In this post I will show you how to use tRPC and a Lambda function
with [Lambda Function URLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-urls.html) to create a ToDo-app for my
terminal. The backend is deployed to AWS using the [Serverless Stack](https://sst.dev/).

This post is divided into two sections.

**Section 1 -** First we set up our Lambda function with a public HTTPS endpoint and set up a type safe remote
procedure call using tRPC.

**Section 2 -** Next, we turn the initial setup into a ToDo-app, by adding a database for persisting state, and
procedures to _create_, _list_ and _complete_ ToDos.

## Overview

Let us look at the system we will have built (after section 2).

The goal is to build a ToDo-app that we can run in our terminal. It will use a **tRPC** client to make requests to a **Lambda function** that stores our ToDos in a **DynamoDB table**. The Lambda function will be exposed as an HTTPS endpoint using a **Lambda Function URL**. As mentioned in the intro, this is deployed to AWS using the [Serverless Stack](https://sst.dev/).



Before we get coding, let us go through what **Lambda Function URLs** and **tRPC**.

First, [**Lambda Function URLs**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-urls.html) is a new feature (from April, 2022) for AWS Lambda that let us expose our Lambda function as HTTPS endpoints directly, without using an API gateway. This has been available for [GCP Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/calling/http) for a while, and it is great to see that Lambda get this feature as well. Here is a comparison of using an API Gateway in front of Lambda and using Function URLs directly:

|                | API Gateway                    | Function URLs |
|----------------|--------------------------------|---------------|
| Authentication | IAM, Cognito, Lambda, API keys | IAM           |
| Timeout        | 30 seconds                     | 15 Minutes    |
| Websocket      | ‚úîÔ∏è                             | ‚ùå             |
| Custom Domains | ‚úîÔ∏è                             | ‚ùå             |
| CORS           | ‚úîÔ∏è                             | ‚úîÔ∏è            |
| Price          | Medium                         | Low           |
| URLs           | One URL multiple endpoints     | Multiple URLs |
| ...            | ...                            | ...           |
| Cool üòé        | ‚ùì                              | ‚úîÔ∏è            |


For most production scenarios, you probably want an API Gateway. For my scenario, I use Function URLs here for a few reasons.
1. Curiosity: Function URLs is a new feature for AWS, and I want to try them out!
2. Using tRPC, we only actually want and need a single endpoint. Perfect match!

In short, I think Function URLs are a great match for my scenario!
The second concept is **tRPC**. It is a Typescript package that lets build fully type safe APIs for both with both server and client. As you will see, it **REALLY** simplifies making requests from a client to the server, while still being type safe. All this without requiring code generation. Read more about it in my post "[Typesafe serverless API with tRPC](

Now we are ready to build a minimal client-server setup.

# Section 1 - The basics

First out, we create the boilerplate for our stack:

## Updating the stack

As I mentioned in the introduction, we do not need the API gateway in our stack. Let's update the stack that SST gave us, and replace the API Gateway with it with a Lambda function. It is located in `./stacks/MyStack.ts`.

Open the `FunctionURL` from the ouput, and you should get a response from your function:


How cool is that? Next we will replace it our tRPC handler Lambda.

## The HTTP handler

Replace the code in `./services/function/lambda.ts` with the following.


SST will automatically reload the handler. If you go to the same URL as before, you will get an error similar to the one
below.


[This is fine](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/this-is-fine)! The API is now a tRPC endpoint, and not ment to be called
directly by the browser.

Instead, let's create our terminal client.

## The client

Create `./client/index.ts` and add:

We invoke our client with `npx ts-node ./client`. Output:


Success!

### Summary - section 1

What happened here?

1. We created a client based on the `AppRouter` from the server
2. We made a request to remote procedure `sayHello` with the argument "`Bilbo`".
3. Our handler (Lambda function) received the request, and understood how to route it to the right procedure `sayHello`
and responded with "`Hello, Bilbo!`"
4. Our client printed the greeting to the terminal



What could be easy to miss here is that **tRPC** makes all this type safe. If I try to call a non-existent procedure, my editor
gives me a helpful warning:

Same if the parameter is the wrong type:

Just as Typescripts makes our Javascript code more reliable using types and warnings in the editor, **tRPC** does the same
for making requests to our remote backend üíò.


This is all we need to set up a tRPC Lambda function on AWS and call it from a client! In the next section we will make our app a lot cooler. See you there!

# Part 2 - Improving the app
In this section we will say goodbye to our basic app **Greeting Generating** app into a cool **ToDo** app! For this we need the following changes

1. Add a DynamoDB table to store our ToDos
2. Add one query and two mutations to our tRPC router
3. Change the client from a one of command to a terminal prompt

## More setup
For the next steps, we need `ksuid` that will be used as ID for our ToDos, and `prompt` that is used by our client.

## Updating the stack
Next, we add a DynamoDB table, using the SST construct [**Table**](https://docs.sst.dev/constructs/Table). Make sure to give the Lambda function permission to access the table, and set the name of the table as an environment.


## Updating the router

To make the code a bit easier to follow, I will break out the database calls to a separate file. We will create two mutations (writers of data) and one query (reader of data).
- `createToDo(id: string, description: string)` (a mutation)
- `completeToDo(id: string)` (a mutation)
- `listToDos()` (a query)
Create a new file at `./services/functions/db.ts`

I will not go into the details of how the request to DynamoDB works. A couple of notes:
1. We get to use the environment variable `TABLE_NAME` we propagated in the stack.
2. The **DynamoDB DocumentClient** is A LOT easier to use the regular SDK client. I highly recommend it!

For a better understanding of how to call DynamoDB with Javascript, I often refer to this [Cheat Sheet from Dynobase](https://dynobase.dev/dynamodb-nodejs) (they also have it for [Go](https://dynobase.dev/dynamodb-golang-query-examples/), [Python](https://dynobase.dev/dynamodb-python-with-boto3/), probably everything else).

Now we can update our existing Lambda at `./services/functions/lambda.ts`:

If we run the client, we get the following output.

Seems to work!

## Client

Finally, let's turn our client into a prompt, as promised.



Replace the client code in `./client/index.ts` as follows:

And for the last time, run the client. The app is now complete üëè!


# Conclusion
We have created a semi-useful ToDo-app using **tRPC** and Lambda functions and Function URLs. I hope by now I have made it apparent how easy **tRPC** (and **SST**) made developing this app. I spent more time writing the silly prompt than hooking up the client to the server, and deploying it all. Great developer experience!

Hope you enjoyed this post.
